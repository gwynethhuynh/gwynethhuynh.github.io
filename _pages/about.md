### Professional Life
Hi! My name is Gwyneth Huynh, and I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for backend development and performance engineering. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from UCLA and am currently pursuing a master’s degree in computer science at Georgia Tech. Over the past year, I have gained valuable experience in managing UCLA's high-performance computing cluster, focusing specifically on optimizing the job scheduler to improve system efficiency and resource allocation. I also have experience processing and visualizing genetic data from my time in Dr. Huiying Li’s Lab at UCLA, where we worked on projects related to the vaginal microbiome and STIs. I am excited to collaborate with other dedicated individuals to create something meaningful.

### Personal Life

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy practicing Wushu, a Chinese martial art. I was an active member of UCLA's Wushu club and competition team, an experience that not only honed my skills but also led to lasting friendships and cherished memories. Additionally, I'm a big foodie who is constantly on the lookout for new things to try!
