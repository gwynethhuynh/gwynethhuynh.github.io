### Professional Life
Hi! My name is Gwyneth Huynh, and I am an aspiring software engineer looking to collaborate with other dedicated individuals to create something meaningful. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from UCLA and am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at Georgia Tech. I have a passion for backend development, with a focus on making processes faster and more efficient. I also have valuable experience in processing and visualizing genetic data from my time in Dr. Huiying Li's Lab at UCLA. Currently, we are engaged in some cool projects related to the vaginal microbiome and STIs.

### Personal Life

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy practicing Wushu, a Chinese martial art. I was an active member of UCLA's Wushu club and competition team, an experience that not only honed my skills but also led to lasting friendships and cherished memories. Additionally, I'm a big foodie who is constantly on the lookout for new things to try!
