## Professional Life
Hi! My name is Gwyneth Huynh and I am an aspiring software engineer. I graduated Summa Cum Laude at UCLA and am currently a master’s student at Georgia Tech. I have experience processing and visualizing microbiome and genetic data in Dr. Huiying Li’s Lab at UCLA. 
## Personal Life
I enjoy practicing wushu, a Chinese Martial Art, outside of research and school. I was previously a part of UCLA’s wushu club and competition team, where I made lifelong friends and cherished memories. I’m also a big foodie and am always looking to try new things!
