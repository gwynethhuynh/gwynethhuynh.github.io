Splitit is a web application using React and Django that allows groups to split restaurant bills according to the amount each person owes. I integrated Google Cloud Vision API to parse receipt images into an itemized total. I also designed a RESTful backend server, enabling receipt information to be stored persistently in an online database.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/splitit.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
